## $\text{\color{lightgreen}Client install}$
To connect to the server you need two client parts ([Http](https://github.com/semachkin/SemenNet/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#textcoloryellowto-install-http-client) and [Rbx](https://github.com/semachkin/SemenNet/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#textcoloryellowto-install-rbx-client) client)
##
### $\text{\color{yellow}To install Http client}$
Download [httpclient.rbxmx](https://github.com/semachkin/SemenNet/releases/download/HttpClient/httpclient.rbxmx) and put it in ServerScriptService
##
### $\text{\color{yellow}To install Rbx client}$
Download [rbxclient.rbxmx](https://github.com/semachkin/SemenNet/releases/download/RbxClient/rbxclient.rbxmx) and put it in StartetPlayerScripts
##
 - ##### To connect to the server, specify the host's proxy IP or private net IP address and server port in the SERVER_CONFIG attributes
 - ##### exchange_rate attribute usually does not exceed 8.3 requests per second. If you want more download [Roblox Mod Manager](https://github.com/MaximumADHD/Roblox-Studio-Mod-Manager) and increase fflag DFIntUserHttpRequestsPerMinuteLimit
- ##### ⚠️ For now, instance replication only works fine on R6 avatars
